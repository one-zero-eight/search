## About

This is an API for the search service in the InNoHassle ecosystem. The search should be carried out on services relevant to Innopolis University students ([moodle](https://moodle.innopolis.university/), [EduWiki](https://eduwiki.innopolis.university/index.php/AcademicCalendar), [Campus Life](http://campuslife.innopolis.ru/), etc.). The search expects to use AI to accept free-form queries from users in addition to just service keywords.

### Technologies

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) & [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) & [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)
- Database and ORM: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Beanie](https://beanie-odm.dev/)
- Formatting and linting: [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- Deployment: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/),
  [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

## Run with Docker

1. Set up project settings file (check [settings.schema.yaml](../InNoHassle-Search/settings.schema.yaml) for more info).
   ```bash
   cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml
   ```
   Edit `settings.yaml` according to your needs.
2. Set up database settings for [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) container
      in `.env` file:Ñ…
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```

1. Start all services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

Now you can find API docs on http://localhost:8004/docs. Good job!


## Development

### Run locally [API]

1. Install [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
3. Install project dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#options-2).
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
4. Set up [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks:

   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install --install-hooks -t pre-commit -t commit-msg
   ```
5. Check that your `settings.yaml` looks like:
   ```yaml
   $schema: "./settings.schema.yaml"
   api_settings:
      db_url: "mongodb://mongoadmin:secret@localhost:27017/db?authSource=admin"
   minio:
      access_key: "minioadmin"
      secret_key: "password"
   ```
6. Set up a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Minio](https://min.io/) instances.

    - Set up database settings for [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) container
      in `.env` file:Ñ…
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Run the database instance:
      ```bash
      docker compose up -d db minio
      ```
    - Make sure to set up the actual database connection in `settings.yaml`.
7. Choose the way to run models: either use Infinity or local models.
   1. If you want to use local models, just not set `infinity_url` in `settings.yaml`
   2. If you want to use Infinity, set `infinity_url` in `settings.yaml` to the url of deployed Infinity engine.
      You can run Infinity engine locally:
      ```bash
      uv run --no-project --with "infinity_emb[all]" --with "transformers<4.49" infinity_emb v2 --model-id intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct --model-id BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3
      ```
      Or use deployed Infinity engine provided by someone else.

8. Run ml client
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m src.ml_service
   ```
9. Run the ASGI server
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m src.api
   ```

**Set up PyCharm integrations**

1. Ruff ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20574-ruff)).
   It will lint and format your code.
   Make sure to enable `Use ruff format` option in plugin settings.
2. Pydantic ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12861-pydantic)).
   It will fix PyCharm issues with
   type-hinting.
3. Conventional commits ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13389-conventional-commit)).
   It will help you
   to write [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).


### Authentication

We use our own IAM service for
authentication - [InNoHassle Accounts](https://github.com/one-zero-eight/InNoHassle-Accounts).
To authenticate the user, you need to pass the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer: <jwt_token>`.
How to get token:

1. First of all, go to [innohassle.ru](https://innohassle.ru) and log in if you are not logged in (or register). That
   will add cookie with
   account secret needed for the next step.
2. Go to [Accounts](https://api.innohassle.ru/accounts/v0/docs#/Tokens/tokens_generate_my_token) API and execute the
   the method `GET /tokens/generate-my-token`, copy the token from the response.
3. Go to the Swagger of API you want to authenticate and click on the `Authorize` button in the top right corner, paste
   the token
   in the `Value` field and click `Authorize`. Now you can use protected endpoints from the Swagger.

### Testing

For testing we use ```pytest```.
* To run tests enter in your terminal:
   ```
   poetry run pytest tests
   ```
* To generate test coverage report run:
   ```
   poetry run pytest  --cov-config=.coveragerc --cov=src/ tests/
   ```
   You can change coverage ignored folders/files in `.coveragerc`.

### Deployment

We use Docker with Docker Compose plugin to run the website on servers.

1. Copy the file with environment variables: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Change environment variables in the `.env` file
3. Copy the file with settings: `cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml`
4. Change settings in the `settings.yaml` file according to your needs
   (check [settings.schema.yaml](../InNoHassle-Search/settings.schema.yaml) for more info)
5. Install Docker with Docker Compose
6. Build a Docker image: `docker compose build --pull`
7. Run the container: `docker compose up --detach`
8. Check the logs: `docker compose logs -f`
