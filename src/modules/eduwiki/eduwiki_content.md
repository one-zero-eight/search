# INNOPOLIS UNIVERSITY MANIFESTO ON MEDIUM OF INSTRUCTION

Innopolis University is committed to the highest international academic standards and
offers the opportunity to study Computer Science and Engineering in English developing
fluency and command of technical and non-technical vocabulary. This is made possible
by the University’s international community of staff and students, speaking several foreign
languages, and in particular English, on a daily basis: students, professors, researchers and
administrative staff.
This commitment is reflected on using English as the language of instruction of Innopolis
University. All classes, teaching, labs, assignments, exercises and practical material are
provided in English. English is expected to be used in the following situations:

* Frontal Classes, including questions
* Frontal Labs, including questions
* Class and labs material
* Technical and non-technical assignments
* Theses and projects
* Written and Oral Exams
* Group Office Hours
* Public Chats related to University life
* Emails to students or colleagues
* Student’s Groups
* Any other document related to education

Being English the officialMedium of Instruction of Innopolis University does not prevent
the use of other languages, and, in particular, Russian, in other situations where two or
more people share a common language, thus English is not necessary used in situations
like informal conversation (questions after classes...), individual office hours, private emails,
private chats.

## Rationale

Fluency in multiple languages reflects on one hand a versatile mind, on the other hand the
significant effort and dedication necessary to acquire such ability. Being multilingual is a
notable skill, no matter what set of languages is in a student’s portfolio, however English
is an important addition for every graduate. The importance of English language can be
summarized in three major points:

* English as a communication means
* English as language of employment
* English as language of science

## English as a communicationmeans

English is the language of international communication; speaking English increases the
chances to communicate virtually anywhere in the world in every field of knowledge. Fluency
in this language allows graduate to travel, encounter new cultures, ideas and to grow as
individual and professionals. It is the mediumfor exchanging technical knowledge as well
feelings and emotions.

## English as language of employment

The opportunities available on the job market today requires graduates to manage a complex
mix of soft and hard skills. Among these language skills have a primarily importance, not only
for international job market, but also for seeking high-profile employment in the Russian
Federation. All themajor companies keep indeed continuous relations with abroad institution
and engineers, manager, salesmen and every other highly-qualified specialists needs
the command of at least one foreign language, typically English. English skills are just as
desirable to employers in any country as they are to employers in English-speaking countries.
Fluency in English allows employees to attend and organize international business meetings.
Where several languages are represented, the chances are that the meeting will be conducted
in English. Employees with language skills will find themselves in a position of advantage
and will be able attending relevant gathering, therefore having the opportunity to advance
faster in the career ladder.

## English as language of science

English is also the language of science and being fluent allows graduates to continuously
educate themselves accessing scientific literature and attending international conferences.
English is essential to pursue a scientific career and to develop the necessary network able to
develop your scientific research.

## Commitment to improve language skills

In order to gain admission to Innopolis University, it is necessary to provide evidence of
specific language levels based on the specific program of enrollment. Over the period study
the English level is expected to grow. The University implements several ways to support
students in their path, some of them being:

* English Courses
* Communication Courses
* Technical Essays in English
* Lab internships
* International projects

## Exceptions

Specific exceptions can be made by the Department of Education for courses that need to
comply with laws and regulations of the Russian Federation (for example “Safety”). The
University commits to provide the opportunity to learn the material of these courses to all
the international students.
In some cases, instructors who are fluent in Russian and possess the appropriate established
terminology used in Russian industry and research can familiarize students with
bilingual terminology that could give students a competitive advantage in the knowledge of
modern terms used at the national and international levels.

## Summary

Innopolis University is committed to provide education of the highest quality using English
as aMediumof Instruction to better prepare future graduate to a dynamic job environment. Staff, teacher and students commit to use English for classes and other major educational situations. Other shared languages can be effectively used in point-to-point communication
whenever there is certainty that no involved participants could be excluded by the conversation for lack of fluency in the used language. This chapter of the teaching regulations collects the suggested practices for staff, teacher and student to keep alive the international
community and be competitive at the national and international level.

# ABOUT LECTURING A COURSE

The old version of the regulations to consider is <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pk0J5C1LIkXHz-aPMCXZPr1SSD0YsLULJ8IslahdyOU/edit>.

## Course Structure and Syllabus

Faculty members can use any instructional mode; however, they should always make sure to
develop and communicate the objectives of the course to the students. In regards to this, the
instructors of the courses should prepare the course syllabus for all of your courses and share
them with the Department of Education (DoE) before a semester begins.
The template that IU is currently using for the course syllabus is in the appendix (Add as an
appendix the template for the syllabus). Such template is then reflected by the DoE into
the online teaching infrastructure (currentlyMoodle) and is used as the core reference for
supplying course material, schedules, and calendars to students.
The deadlines to prepare and submit the syllabus are June 30 (for Fall semester courses),
October 31 (for Spring semester courses), May 01 (for Summer semester courses).
The instructor of the course is expected to teach with physical presence at least 70% of
the lectures.

## Evaluation of students performance

The following is stipulated by the University Regulation “Ongoing and interim assessment
of students’ knowledge in the autonomous noncommercial organization of higher education
«Innopolis University».”

### Ongoing academic progress assessment (OPA)

1. Ongoing academic progress assessment (OPA) is carried out by all types of self-study
and contact work of students prescribed by the disciplines, practices, and programs
of research work. The OPA is carried out by a professor giving courses, by the head of
practice, or by the tutor of the research work.

2. The forms of the OPA include:

* individual realization of software code,
* individual assignments,
* practical and laboratory work,
* projects,
* examinations,
* colloquiums,
* tests (hand-written or computer-based),
* reports, essays, surveys,
* oral polls,
* discussions, training, workshops.

3. Other forms of OPA might be established in accordance with the curriculum and
schedule.

4. The Instructor determines the frequency, the procedure, and the forms of OPA, as well
as the evaluation system for it. The Instructor has a right to introduce corrections in
the quantity and procedure of OPA.

5. The Instructor must enter OPA results into the LMSMoodle.

6. The OPA results must be taken into account when the final grade is given during course
evaluation. Grades received by students during the OPA are not subject to retake.

### Studentsmid-semester evaluation

Within the framework of the educational process’s quality assessment, the IU Department
of Education analyzes students’ progress based on the OPA results around the middle of
each semester. Based on this analysis, members of the DoE hold special meetings with the
under-performing students to assess the reasons behind their struggling. The following
procedures are in place:

1. Each course instructor should estimate students’ performance by the end of the 9th
week of the semester. This is an estimation of individual students’ final grade

2. Such an estimate should be entered in the Moodle section of the course using an
assessment named “Mid Semester Evaluation (for DoE)”

3. Such an estimate should be defined with the usual letter grades (A, B, C, D - where D
means “fail”)

It is noteworthy that the mid-semester evaluation is not the same as the midterm evaluation.

### Final evaluation

The official term for the final course evaluation is the “Interim assessment” (IA), and it will
be used below. The following is stipulated by the University Regulation “Ongoing and interim
assessment of students’ knowledge in the autonomous noncommercial organization of higher
education Innopolis university":

1. The schedule and the place of IA are drafted by the DoE one week prior to the beginning
of an IA, which must be approved by the Director of the University. Academic
faculty and students must be informed of this via their corporate e-mails.

2. The IA is conducted after completing the course or practice in full or in part. This assessment
will take place in a form that depends on the educational program, the work
program of the discipline (course modules) and following the procedures, prescribed
by relevant regulations.

3. The forms of interim assessment are:

* a test (including a pass/fail test),
* an examination.

Both of these can be carried out in the following forms:

* verbally and in a written form,
* in the form of testing, including the use of computers, software and hardware, as

well as

* in the form of an essay or
* project defense.

The form of the interim assessment is determined by the Instructor. Students must
be informed about the IA form.

4. The final grade for the course (module) and practice (research work) can include the
results of the OPA.

5. Recording the IA results can be conducted in the following 2 ways:

* The Instructor enters IA results into the LMSMoodle after which the results are

transferred into the intermediate attestation report.

* The Instructor fills out the intermediate attestation report (Appendix 1 of the

cited document) and submits it to the DoE. The DoE employees then transfer the grades into LMSMoodle.

6. The results cannot be reviewed after being entered into LMS Moodle and the interim
assessment report.

7. Final results of the examination (tests) from the interim assessment report shall be entered
into the student’s electronic record books (LMS Moodle, a system of educational process control 1C: University, student’s portfolio, and student’s personal account
(my.university.innopolis.ru)).

### Rules on final examinations

1. If a student has no valid reason for being absent from the exam, he/she is considered
to not have passed the exam and not fulfilled academic requirements.

2. The Instructor can provide the list of supportive materials that students are allowed
to use during the exam.

3. The use of non-allowed supportive materials during the exams, breach of study discipline
(cheating, use of mobile phones or PC, attempts to talk to others, etc.) as well as
infringement of the regulations is prohibited. These incidents can serve as a ground
for removal of the student from the room and awarding thema D (unsatisfactory) or
F (Fail) marks.

4. If any of the incidents described above occur, the Instructor should inform the Vice-
Rector for Education of this in written form or via the corporate mail. The Vice-Rector
in their turn sends an official note on Regulations infringement to the Director of the
University for further consideration and decision.

5. Presence of the third parties on exams and tests without the written permission of the
Vice-Rector for Education of the University is not allowed.

retake an exam on individual terms. The terms are approved by the direct order of the
University Director.

8. For students who provide justification documents for their absence in the exam (sick leave
sheet, medical certificate, etc.), the examination period may be extended by the number
of calendar days indicated in the presented document. This document should be
provided no later than three working days after being issued.

9. The following procedure is applied for the extension of the examination session:

* A student provides the DoE with:

1) A statement in the name of Vice-Rector
for Education to extend the examination period;
2) Documents confirming the
reason for the extension of the examination period (a medical certificate or other
documents).

2. as well as with other datasets.

Similarity checks shall only be applied to long text works in natural or programming language
to prove the fact of copying. For example, similarity reports are a necessary part of thesis
validation procedure and coding assignments, but such reports cannot be applied to exam works and tests, where similarity does not necessarily mean copying. As there is no universal
scale for similarity, for each particular assignment and course professor should clearly specify
expectations for similarity in the policy document or in assignment notification. If a group
of students receives the same assignment, not passing a similarity check shall be treated as
plagiarism. If a student is doing a personal task (thesis, project, ...), high similarity cases shall
be managed by the supervisor. In our university, we use jPlag for code similarity detection,
Turnitin for essay check and Antiplagiat for thesis check. If you want to get tutorials on these
systems, please contact the Department of Education (education@innopolis.ru).

### Statement

All academic misconduct cases shall be reported to the IU Department of Education (DoE)
and Student Affairs Office (SAO) using the official email address (education@innopolis.ru,
319@innopolis.ru). Specify the following:

1. Student(s) name(s) involved and their roles;
2. Date and time the case was detected;
3. Course affected by the situation;
4. Short description of the situation. Please refer to this policy or other policy documents

which you use to identify the misconduct.

The Student Affairs Office should create a track record of student’s activities including
misconduct cases starting from the Bootcamp participation until the final thesis defense.
We assume that there is a publicly available cheating policy document for the whole
course, particular assignment, or exam, i.e. it is clear if it is allowed or not to use electronic
devices, notes, cheat sheets, books, etc. during the tests. Any violation of the said policy, as
well as plagiarism cases, shall be considered equally.
The committee decision shall be taken with a consensus of all participants.
The process participants shall be able to know the committee members.
The committee shall be of 3 people: a course professor, a teacher not involved in the
course affected, and an official student representative.
Cases involving the first-year students should be considered with the most thoroughness.

### Procedure

Should an instructor (teaching assistant or professor) have reason to believe that one or more
works are copied from unauthorized resources, and action on a test is taken in violation, or work of one student is copied from another (as defined in plagiarism clarification), the
the procedure below shall be followed.

1. The instructor shall report the case to DoE and SAO (education@innopolis.ru and 319@innopolis.ru).
2. The instructor shall inform the suspected students about the above finding separately, and discuss this incident. They shall be penalized as per the recommendations below and a report will be submitted to DoE outlining these decisions. In case of copying from each other—both students shall be penalized. The actions of the instructor are considered final.
3. In the event of an appeal to the DoE, the student must present a clear written rationale for why the decision was in error. If the DoE agrees that the student appeal has merit then an appeal committee is formed of one student representative, the course PI, and an unrelated professor selected by the DoE. Otherwise, the decision of the course PI is considered final and the report is entered.

* The student shall contact the committee and provide the said committee with the following materials: a cheating policy for this course/test/exam, students’ papers/code, any other findings, including the student’s arguments.
* The committee shall study the above materials.
* The committee can contact the students to listen to their arguments or ask questions. However, this shall be upon the committee’s discretion.
* The committee shall make an appeal decision to either accept or reject. This decision shall be final.
* Any fabrications of data or false statements made to the DoE or the Committee during the appeals process will be seen as a separate instance of misconduct and the DoE or the Committee may impose additional outcomes if necessary when the actions have impeded investigation.

#### Procedure from instructor’s point of view

1. Instructor reports the violation case to DoE and SAO.
2. Instructor notifies students involved (can be BCC in report email).
3. In case of student’s appeal, instructor may be invited to participate in committee.

#### Procedure from student’s point of view

1. The student gets a notification about academic misconduct.
2. The student may appeal. He/she collects the documents (3.a) and submits to DoE and

SAO.

#### Procedure from an administration point of view

1. DoE and SAO get the report about student misconduct.
2. SAO tracks the record and asks DoE to act in case violation is not the first (see penalty section).
3. In case of student’s appeal, DoE with the help of programmanagers collects a committee.

### Penalty

Note that the following are the minimal actions.

1. Should a student be found to have committed misconduct for the first time, such a student shall receive zero points for the particular work (assignment/exam/test/homework)
2. Should a student be found to have committed misconduct for the second time, the following actions shall be taken:
   1. Such a student shall:
      1. receive zero points for the course (or courses if 2 cheating instances are detected in different courses);
      2. be sent to retake.
   2. An official warning shall be issued for the said student.
3. Should a student be found to have committed misconduct for the third time (without respect to the course), such a student shall be expelled from Innopolis University.

In the event that the actions were of a grievous nature, e.g. a student using a work for hire
an assignment, a bomb/shooting threat, etc., the DoE maintains the right to increase the
outcomes. A student might also be subject to additional actions on the part of the professor
or DoE in order to maintain class order, have recompense of the action, or in order to learn a
proper scholarly methodology, e.g. be required to make an apology to classmates affected, be
required to write an essay or attend a course on how to cite properly, etc.

# SUMMARY OF THE BS DEGREES

The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and the Bachelor of Science in Computer
Engineering at Innopolis University aim at creating professional software engineers, data
scientists, robotics engineers, security & blockchain experts, and junior scientistswho possess
a deep understanding of fundamental theoretical and practical results of computer science
and engineering, are able to handle the fundamental mathematical abstractions to elaborate
data, can use modern tools, languages and technologies, and can understand the underlying
human, social and industrial aspects of information technology.

Moreover, a person with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science or a Bachelor of
Science in Computer Engineering acquired at Innopolis University should be eminently
qualified to enter the IT job market in Russia in the position of junior software developer,
software engineer, robotics engineer, data scientist, or equivalent.

The primary target of these graduates is the industry of the city of Innopolis. Therefore, the
the program foresees many opportunities for synergies with these companies and businesses in
Innopolis and the curricula reflect these industry-university synergies, leveraging substantial
benefit for both parties.

Both the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and the Bachelor of Science in Computer
Engineering at Innopolis University are organized in 4 years of instruction performed
mostly in English.

The first 2 years contain the fundamental courses in mathematics and physics, and in
computer science and engineering. Students have the option of selecting one of two tracks:
(a) Computer Engineering, (b) Computer Science.

The major goal of such an approach is to distinguish the difference in paths that consider
students' career goals. For instance, if a student is looking to work in cybersecurity or as
a systems administrator, computer science may be a good fit for him/her. If his/her goal
is to eventually become a software architect or developer, a degree in computer science
or computer engineering will equip him/her for the job. Advanced computer science curricula
thoroughly cover how networks and systems security protocols work while teaching
programming and appropriate mathematical concepts.
Computer scientists typically have an understanding of:

* programming languages;
* how to run, maintain, and fix operating systems;
* data structures and algorithms;
* basic cybersecurity and cryptography;
* knowledge of designing, coding, and testing software;
* how computer networks work and how to manage them.

Some common skills a computer engineer utilize include:

* A complete understanding of how computer hardware and architecture work;
* knowledge of designing, coding, and testing software;
* flexibility to work with a wide range of software, which can be highly specialized depending

on the company and/or industry;

* ability to build your own PC systems and repair/maintain device drivers.

At the moment there is no special selection procedure for each track. Students pick the
program by their own on the basis of the knowledge obtained in Higher School.
In the next 2 years the students have the option of selecting one of the four streams: (a)
Software Engineering, (b) Data Science, (c) Robotics, and (d) Security-Blockchain.

To provide a solid grounding for the application of the studies, there is an internship at
the end of every year. This can be performed in a software company located in the city of
Innopolis, or also, if such option is not practical, in a company located elsewhere in Russia,
in the university labs or administration, or in another suitable institution.

The curriculum also attaches significant importance to instruction in the humanities
(history and philosophy), focusing on the aspects most relevant to ICT.
At the end of each degree, students write theses, and to write theses effectively, they take a
course on Academic Research and Writing Culture. This thesis reflects the highest standards
of university education and can also be developed in collaboration with a company.

## Organization of the information about the BS Degree

The information about the BS Degree is organized as follows. Chapter 5 on page 33 describes
the overall structure of the degree in terms of the distribution of credits and courses. Chapter 6
on page 36 outlines the main educational goals of the degree and the structures of the various
courses of instruction. Then there are four chapters discussing the fourth stream: Chapter
7on page 47 for Software Engineering, Chapter 8 on page 52 for Data Science, Chapter 9 on page 57 for Robotics, and Chapter 10on page 60 for Security-Blockchain. Eventually, Chapter
11 on page 64 presents in depth the core courses taught in the degree and Chapter 12 on
page 66 summarises the electives. In Appendix ?? on page ?? there is a graph summarising
the overall curriculumand the dependencies between core courses, then in Appendix A on
page 9 there is the description of the multidisciplinary exam, Appendix B on page 11 contains
the procedures to elaborate and defend the thesis. Appendix C on page 22 contains the key
competences acquired during the first two years of instruction while Appendix D on page 24
details the knowledge areas covered by each of the streams. Finally, Appendix E on page 28
list the main tools, technologies and programming languages introduced in the degree and
Appendix F on page 30 specifies the specific courses of the direction of finance technologies.

# STRUCTURE OF THE DEGREE

## Credits

Overall, the degree requires the student to acquire 240 credits organized over 4 years of study,
with a pace of 60 credits per year.
One credit of study approximately corresponds to 36 academic hours of effort per student,
which can be organized differently depending on the course, as detailed further in Section
14.4. This means that a course of 4 credits requires an effort of 144 hours,1 and an internship
of 8 credits requires 288 hours (about 7 weeks).

## Organization of the Courses of Instruction

Courses can be organized in a variety of ways, taking advantage of various teaching mechanisms,
such as:

* Lc: Class Lecture;
* Tut: Class Tutorial,where the instructor explains concepts guiding students through practical exercises;
* Lab: Group Laboratory, where the students perform homework and/or exercises and/or projects coordinated by the instructor, asking help from the instructor as needed, and receiving if needed also additional material directly from the instructor.
* IL: Individual Labs, where the students perform exercises and refer to the instructor in person or via electronic media to get support in case of need.

During the first two years of instruction:

* Math and science courses have typically the structure of 2Lc-2Lab-2IL, meaning 2 academic hours per week of class lectures, 2 academic hours of labs, and 2 academic hours of individual labs;
* Computer science and engineering courses have the structure of 2Lc-2Tut-2Lab, meaning 2 academic hours per week of class lectures, 2 academic hours of class tutorials, and 2 academic hours of labs.

The technical courses have the structure of 2Lc-2Lab-2IL meaning 2 academic hours per week of class lectures, 2 academic hours of labs, and 2 academic hours of individual labs. The courses in humanities have the structure of 2Lc-4IL.

## Internships

Every year the students have a mandatory internship during the summer break. There are
three types of internships:

* Industrial – students work in Innopolis University partner IT companies, primarily located within the city of Innopolis
* Scientific – students work in Innopolis University labs on ongoing research and development tasks
* Administrative – students work in different Innopolis University departments on IT analysis, design, and implementation projects.

It is also possible to have internships that combine these three types.
The internship usually starts once the exam session for the spring semester is completed.

## Knowledge of English

A graduate fromthe program is expected to know English at least at the level of IELTS 7. To
achieve this goal, Innopolis University takes the following steps:2

* At admission at the university, the student must have a knowledge of English at least at level of IELTS 5.
* At the end of the first year of instruction, the student must have a knowledge of English equivalent to at least the level 5.5 of IELTS.
* English equivalent to at least the level 6 of IELTS.
* At the end of the third year of instruction, the student must have a knowledge of English equivalent to at least the level 6.5 of IELTS.
* At the end of the fouth year of instruction, the studentmust have a knowledge of English equivalent to at least the level 7 of IELTS.

The university will make available to the student the fundamental resources to achieve
the required levels. However, it is the responsibility of the student to achieve them, taking
advantage of resources provided by the university and others.

## Multidisciplinary Exam

At the end of the second year of study, the student has to pass amultidisciplinary examaimed
at evaluating their comprehensive understanding of the discipline beyond the borders of an
individual subject. This ensures that students who progress to years three and four have the
ability to engage in system-oriented thinking and have the capacity to solve broadly-based IT
problems.

## Number of Admitted Students

The number of admitted students is defined by the Department of Education based on the
requests of the senior university administration and of the university stakeholders.

# MAIN EDUCATIONAL AIMS AND STRUCTURES

## Overall Educational Goals

Innopolis University aims to prepare its students for working in various IT-related professions
as software engineers, data scientists, robotics engineers, and junior scientists, to name a few.
A graduate of Innopolis University should be highly qualified to enter the IT job market in
Russia in the position of Junior Software Engineer or its equivalent and to be immediately
productive.

A graduate of Innopolis University is able to:

1. Understand the fundamental theoretical concepts and practical results of computer
science and engineering,

2. Use programming languages and other representative tools for information technology,
with a firmunderstanding of the mathematical abstraction behind these technologies,
and

3. Appreciate the underlying human, social and industrial aspects of information technology.
Innopolis University aims to create a vibrant international environment for learning. For
this reason, the primary language of education at Innopolis University is English.
Innopolis University also aims to prepare its students for the constantly evolving world of
information technology. A graduate of Innopolis University possesses not only IT skills but
also various essential soft skills such as self-reliance, team-work, and time management.
To facilitate interaction with local and global industry, different means of delivery of the
individual courses and of whole degrees are deployed, e.g., problem-based teaching, flipped
classrooms, and inverted syllabi.
Innopolis University attracts top students in Russia and worldwide.

## Organization of Studies

The curriculum spans four years.
First and second-year students can choose one of the following tracks:

* Computer Engineering
* Computer Science

Despite their choice students take fundamental courses in Engineering, Mathematics and
Computer Science in each semester but in different depths of studying.
Each track contains the same set of core courses, but the courses that are taught in different
level of depth have different titles, e.g. Calculus-I vsMathematical Analysis-I, Analytical
Geometry - I vs Essentials of Analytical Geometry-I, Programming Software Systems-I vs
Introduction to Programming-I.

Also, these tracks have a set of courses with lectures that are taught for all the students
simultaneously but with different approaches to practical classes, e.g. Computer Architecture
(Fundamentals of Computer Architecture) and DiscreteMath, Philosophy(Logic).
The computer science track focuses on topics in computational theory. These include the
virtual aspects of computers, focusing on software, rather than hardware. As a field that is
closely aligned with mathematics, computer science applies theoretical ideas to solve real
world problems. Computer science degree programs require courses including analysis of
algorithms, operating system principles, computer architecture and software engineering,
so an interest in math, puzzles, and problem-solving would suit a student well. A degree in
computer science will cover essential hardware and software topics, including computer
organization and architecture.
Computer science is often described as more abstract and less hands-on than computer
engineering. As a computer scientist, students will focus on using computational theory,
mathematics and data structures to write effective codes.
Computer engineering track focuses on how to build devices including robots. It is a field
that combines physics, electrical engineering and computer science. The focus of computer
engineering is on hardware, rather than software and it’s closer to Robotics rather than to
Software Development.

The work of a computer engineer works in the physical world and involves understanding
howwe can harness the laws of physics and electronics to create better computer components.
They aremore likely to spendmore time at a lab bench than writing code. Fromthis point
of view computer engineering is often described as more practical activity than computer
engineering. Learning the same subjects students will bemore focused on the applications
of the theory for solving real life problems.
Third and fourth-year students can choose one of the following streams:

* Software engineering
* Data science
* Robotics
* Security-Blockchain

Each stream has its own set of specific courses, as well as those that are shared with
other streams. Moreover, the stream in data science has a direction in finance technologies,
specializing data science for the banking and financial industry.
The organization of the courses is as detailed in Tables 14.2 and 4.2. In addition to them
there are courses for sport in every semester. Furthermore, students of each stream do a
project in the spring semester of the third year, and a thesis in both semesters of the final
(fourth) year.

Each of the taught courses (core and electives) and the thesis course done during the
semester count for 4 credits. The sport courses count for one credit each. The Life Safety
course counts for 2 credits. The summer internship counts for 14 credits in the first year, 10
credits in the second and third years, and 8 credits in the fourth year.

## Main Areas and Knowledge Areas

To effectively design the curriculum, we identify areas that must be covered in the curriculum.
We distinguish the following two kinds of areas, i.e., main areas and knowledge areas. First,
the main areas are the key components of the degree program listed as follows:

* (CSE) Computer Science and Engineering
* (M)Math
* (P) Physics
* (H) Humanities
* (M-CS)Math and Computer Science
* (IT) Internship and Theses

Meanwhile, the knowledge areas shown in the following list identify more specifically the
body of knowledge that must be covered in the curriculum.

* (IS) Intelligent Systems
* (GV) Graphics and Visualization
* (PL) Programming Languages
* (PD) Parallel and Distributed Programming
* (SDF) Software Development Fundamentals
* (SE) Software Engineering
* (EE) Electrical Engineering
* (CE) Control Engineering
* (OS) Operating Systems
* (CN) Computational Science
* (MP)Mathematical Physics
* (Ph) Philosophy
* (Hs) History
* (FN) Finance
* (ME)Mechanical Engineering
* (AL) Algorithms and Complexity
* (HCI) Human Computer Interaction
* (BE) Bio-engineering
* (SP) Social Issues and Professional Practice
* (CM) Communications
* (AO) Architecture and Organization
* (SP) Social Issues and Professional Practice

We identified the knowledge areas based on the CurriculumGuidelines for undergraduate
Degree Programs in Computer Science by the joint task force between ACM(Association for
ComputingMachinery) and IEEE Computer Society in 2013.1 Note that a knowledge area is a
higher-level concept than a course and an individual course can cover diverse knowledge
areas when appropriate.

We provide throughout the document how each course is mapped to a main area and
knowledge areas. We also provide the distribution of the knowledge areas in the first two
years, and in the three specialized streams.

## Structure of the First Two Years of Instruction

The primary objective of the first two-year curriculum is to provide a solid scientific and technical
foundation for a career in Computer Science and Engineering, prior to the development
of specialized knowledge and skills, which occurs in the second two years of the curriculum.
More especially, the aim of the first two years is to foster the following fundamental skills
and knowledge:

* Ability to develop computer programs and systems efficiently. Related courses are

Introduction to Programming and Software Project where the former focuses on improving
the programming skills of students, while the latter also involves other diverse
software development activities such as software design and maintenance.

* Ability to solve problems efficiently using computer programs. Related courses are

Data Structures and Algorithms, and Introduction to AI.

* Ability to understand the theory and concept of computer systems. Related courses are

Computer Architecture, DataModeling and Databases, Operating Systems, Networks,
and Theoretical Computer Science.

To this end, the curriculum emphasizes building mathematical foundations and covers
diverse math subjects—Mathematical Analysis, Differential Equations, Analytic Geometry, and Linear Algebra, Discrete Math, and Probability and Statistics. With strong math skills, students will be able to grasp any advanced subjects in their interest domain of information
technology.
The curriculum also provides basic subjects on Physics and Electronics. Knowledge of
these subjects will be essential in pursuing further study in Robotics, and other areas of
information technology such as Cyber-Physical Systems, and the Internet of Things.
Specifically, the students during the first year (Table 6.3) take courses on the most fundamental
computer science/engineering subjects (Introduction to Programming I/II, Data
Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architecture), math (Mathematical Analysis I/II, Analytic
Geometry and Linear Algebra I/II, DiscreteMath, Probability, and Statistics), and physics
(Physics I). They are the languages of information technology and will be the fundamental
foundation when students pursue their specialized streams in their last two years of the
program.
During the second year (Table 6.4), students take essential computer science/engineering
courses such as data modeling and Databases I/II, Operating Systems, Software Project, Networks,
and Theoretical Computer Science. Also, Introduction to AI is, given its importance,
taken by all students. As in the first year, students also take courses on math (Differential
Equations, Stochastic Processes). Lastly, students also take a fundamental course on
electronics (Physics II) in the second year.
Last but not least, internship (Internship I/II) is a core part of the curriculum throughout
the first two years. Students should complete their internship every summer.

## Overview of the Second Two Years of Instruction

Equipped with fundamental competencies in math, engineering, and computer science
in the first two years of the BS program, the students enter the third and the fourth year where they are trained on four different career paths having the fastest-growing employment
opportunities in the world. The four streams are:
• Software engineering,
• Data science,
• Robotics,
• Security-Blockchain
The Software Engineering Streamcombines system theory, computer science, and software
engineering for students interested in pursuing careers in software engineering. The Data Science Stream integrates intelligent systems, computer science, and data science to
produce graduates with the skills needed to evaluate and interpret big data. The Robotics
Stream is aimed at giving fundamental knowledge in mechanics, mechatronics, electrical
engineering, control theory, and robotics to provide students an understanding of the basic
principles of robotic systems in particular and technical systems in general. Finally, the
Security-Blockchain stream focuses on information security, relating to the design and development
of secure computer software, providing in-depth handling of the current landscape
of vulnerabilities, risks, and security disciplines. Alongside computer security, the stream
also covers aspects related to distributed ledgers technologies (e.g., cryptocurrencies and
blockchain technologies).
Students take core courses through the third and fourth years, some of which belong
to individual streams while others are shared. They also take one-five electives, one in
the second semester of the third year and others in the fourth year. Students also need to
complete a project in the third year. During the fourth year, students need to complete their
theses supervised by Innopolis University faculty.

# What is Moodle

[Moodle](https://moodle.innopolis.university/my/) is a widely spread [Learning Management System (LMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system). Such systems can automate multiple educational procedures. In our university we use Moodle for 2 major tasks: **professor-to-student** and **professor-to-administration** communication. In particular *at least* we use Moodle:

* as an entry point for a course for offline and *online* students;
* to publish a course structure, regulations, and materials;
* to schedule graded activities (quizzes, homeworks, exams, ...);
* to store a digital footprint of a student, mostly in a form of uploaded assignments and quizzes;
* for timely grading and grade publishing.

# Moodle minimum

As soon as you get access to the course, you should:

1. Upload or link a **course syllabus**, preferably in a form of an [eduwiki page](https://eduwiki.innopolis.university/index.php/Main_Page).
2. Create **Attendance** element, and then create teaching sessions inside. Attendance check is mandatory for electives and labs.
3. Create **course sections**, preferably with respect to syllabus topics.
4. Create **all graded activities** with submission deadlines in advance.
5. **Setup grading**. Moodle by default equally weights all assignments and uses default letter scale. To adjust this behavior please refer to *Grades* menu of the course. Useful tips are given in [this video about grades setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCs6F-PfBJ4&list=PLneu1tELBieKgdGI6MXpgCQ-KwTnItYu-&index=7&t=3s) and [this video about mid-semester evaluation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5cUlVIN7J8&list=PLneu1tELBieKgdGI6MXpgCQ-KwTnItYu-&index=8). **NB University administration automatically imports final grades from Moodle, thus you should ensure that grades are correct in 2 days after a final exam**.

# Expected state

As Moodle is used as a default **professor-to-student** communication channel, we expect to see there:

* **Course material**: lecture notes, lecture recording, scientific acticles, presentations, links to repositories and chats, and other course artifacts.
* **Grading feedback**. Assignments and quizzes graded in Moodle should include justification of the grade. This can include explicit grading schemas, personal feedbacks to student uploads, feedback to their open question answers, etc.

# Good to have

* Our university has a default [Academic Misconduct Policy](https://eduwiki.innopolis.university/index.php/About_lecturing_a_course#Academic_misconduct_policy). If you want to override these rules, you can do this in Moodle.
* Dedicated **grading policy** section in a course header.

# Further reading

Some motivation and useful tricks are given in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLneu1tELBieKgdGI6MXpgCQ-KwTnItYu-).

Please don't hesitate to contact [Miloslav](https://t.me/Mls181) and [Rinat](https://t.me/rin_akhm) to get Moodle assitance.

# Extended instructions for the Moodle learning portal

**What is Moodle? How do I access it?**

At our university, we use Moodle for 2 main tasks:
professor-student communication
professor-administration communication

More specifically, we use Moodle:

* as a starting point for a course for offline and online students;
* publications of the course structure, rules and materials;
* for planning assessed activities (quizzes, homework, exams, etc.);
* for storing a student's digital fingerprint, mainly in the form of uploaded assignments and quizzes;
* for timely assessment and publication of assessments.

Authorization in Moodle: Log in -> Log in using your Innopolis University account (authorization by your username and password)

An auxiliary article on working in Moodle [is available at the link](https://eduwiki.innopolis.university/index.php/HowToMoodle).
If you have any questions, you can seek advice [Miloslav](https://t.me/Mls181).

**How can I get a link to the course I teach?**

The list of courses to be taught by the teacher is displayed in the course schedule table for the semester. Before the start of the semester, we add the teacher to his courses in advance, which are then displayed in his/her personal account in Moodle, in the Dashboard section.

**What obligations do I have to the UI on the moodle? Course description? Grades?**

The structure of the created course page, in which the course materials are located, adds materials to the teacher(s), assistant(s) /assistant(s) of the course.

As a rule, a Syllabus must be present at the course, which students can familiarize themselves with..
We ask you to send the finished syllabus by personal message to telegram: [Miloslav](https://t.me/Mls181).
In the main course description, you can specify: goals, teacher contacts and links to repositories on the Telegram channel/chat on your subject.

Elements of materials on the course:

* Commitment to the UI

Accumulation of methodological materials - syllabus, course materials,
accumulation of artifacts of students - homework done electronically. the format must be accessible from Moodle..

You can add blocks, for example, structuring your course strictly by week, and then add lecture notes, lecture notes, scientific articles, presentations, videos, assignments, texts, etc. to each week's block.

Most of the course elements can have restrictions: start time, end time. It is possible to set restrictions: until the "survey" is passed“ the "final test" will not open for passing.

It is possible to add elements of educational materials to the course in Moodle: lecture and practical material, tests, assignments, surveys, etc. are uploaded by the teacher / teacher's assistant.

Evaluative feedback is tasks and tests evaluated in Moodle must contain a justification for the assessment. This may include clear assessment schemes, personal feedback on student downloads, feedback on their answers to open questions, etc.

Grades are set in a separate section, but depend on the evaluation criteria for your subject. For example, you can configure in the format "A" "B" ”With ” "D”, and/or PASS/FAIL, set % according to the criteria from the syllabus.

Background information on the section: estimates and their settings: <https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Grades>

If you have any questions about any settings, you can contact [Miloslav](https://t.me/Mls181) for help and advice on working on the Moodle portal.

**Any documents uploaded there? What do I have to do?**

Once you have access to the course, you should:

* Download or link the course program, preferably in the form of an edu wiki page.
* Create an attendance element, and then create training sessions inside it.
* Attendance check is mandatory for electives and laboratory work - check about "Attendance” on Moodle [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGCZRMbXsec)
* Create sections of the course, preferably according to the topics of the curriculum.
* Create all classified actions with submission deadlines in advance.

**Am I obliged to communicate with students in Moodle, or can I send them study materials as it is convenient for me?**

You can upload tasks to Moodle in advance and hide them from students, and open them when necessary.
You can share a link to a chat/Telegram channel with students for assignments from Moodle.

**How to make a formula for grading so that it matches my grading scheme that exists on the course?**

By default, Moodle weighs all assignments equally and uses the default letter scale. To adjust this behavior, please refer to the course grades menu. Useful tips are given in this video about setting up grades and in this video about mid-semester assessment. The administration of NB University automatically imports final grades from Moodle, so you should make sure that the grades are correct within 2 days after the final exam.

The Moodle forum on the topic of ratings and their settings is available at the link: <https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Grades>

If you have any questions about any settings, you can contact [Miloslav](https://t.me/Mls181).
for help and advice on working on the Moodle portal.

**How much time do I have to check my homework? Is there a mandatory deadline when grades should stand?**

Each teacher has their own criteria and deadlines for checking homework and test results.
The deadline should not exceed the date of the exam. If you are doing homework, you are required to tell students how much you are checking it. The recommended period is one week.

**Who should I contact if I don't understand how to use some kind of Moodle functionality?**

# General information about elective courses

### What is an elective course?

An elective is a course chosen by students based on their interest.

There are two types of electives: technical and humanities

### What should be the content of an elective course?

The content and topics can be suggested by the instructor who is delivering the course. If you are hesitating as to what exactly to offer we can help you out.

Generally speaking, we welcome industry-related subjects. The main criteria are two:

1. subjects have to be suitable for students given their background;
2. subjects must not repeat the core subjects that students take during their degree. (See: core subjects by each year BSc & MS)

Some subjects of interest to our students could be:

1. Industrial Programming in Java;
2. Backend Development with Kotlin;
3. Advanced С++: New Language Concepts, Features and Mechanisms;
4. UX/UI design;
5. Back-end development with Python.

Example subjects we are already delivering:

1. Introduction to Quantum Programming;
2. Front-end Web Development;
3. Programming in Haskell;
4. Introduction to Game Development;
5. iOS Development with Swift;
6. Cross-platform Mobile Development with Flutter.

### How many classes/teaching hours does a course take?

A technical elective course is 40 academic hours of teaching, i.e. 20 classes (90 minutes each). These 20 classes can be a mix of lectures and labs, i.e. theory and practice, or any other contact format (masterclasses, presentations, training, …).
In addition to that the students are expected to have 140 academic hours for self-studying work (homeworks, projects, assignments, reading, etc) and the exam including preparation.

A humanities elective is 30 academic hours of teaching (lectures and labs) and extra 42 academic hours for a student’s self-study (homeworks, projects, assignments, reading, etc).

### What is the language of teaching?

English.

# Offering a course

We use [Moodle](https://moodle.innopolis.university) as our LMS. Here are the tutorials explaining how to work with it:

* [IU Moodle setup: Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bToQtv0h-u8&list=PLneu1tELBieKgdGI6MXpgCQ-KwTnItYu-)
* [Recommendation for setting the final grades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSq_2mjYghE)

2. Remote teaching

In some groups, we have students who are authorized to attend lessons online. In this case, you need to use a video conference system. It is recommended to use Microsoft Teams, but it is up to you to use your preferred software for this purpose. Just remember, students should have clear algorithms for joining the lesson together with the tools needed. For those not familiar with any video conference system, we recommend using Microsoft Teams:

* [Microsoft Teams quick start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyi5064KLCQ&list=PLneu1tELBieKgdGI6MXpgCQ-KwTnItYu-&index=8)

3. Attendance tracking

We use automatic authentication software [BAAM](https://baam.duckdns.org/) compatible with Moodle to simplify the process of attendance tracking. Watch the video below to see how it works:

# Что такое мудл? Как мне туда попасть?

В нашем университете мы используем Moodle для 2 основных задач: общения профессора со студентом и профессора с администрацией. В частности, по крайней мере, мы используем Moodle:
в качестве отправной точки для курса для офлайн- и онлайн-студентов;
публикации структуры курса, правил и материалов;
для планирования оцененных мероприятий (викторины, домашние задания, экзамены и т.д.);
для хранения цифрового отпечатка студента, в основном в виде загруженных заданий и викторин;
для своевременной оценки и публикации оценок.

Вспомогательная статья по работе в Moodle доступна по ссылке (<https://eduwiki.innopolis.university/index.php/HowToMoodle>).
Если у Вас есть вопросы, Вы можете обратиться за консультацией к <https://t.me/Mls181>.

# Как и у кого мне узнать ссылку на мой курс, который я преподаю?

Список курсов, который будет вести преподаватель, отображается в таблице расписания курсов на семестр.
До начала семестра, мы заранее добавляем преподавателя на его курсы, которые затем отображаются в его/её личном кабинете в Moodle, в разделе Dashboard.

# Какие у меня есть обязательства перед УИ по мудлу? Описание курса? Оценки?

Структура созданной страница курса, в котором располагаются материалы курса, добавляет материалы преподаватель (-и), помощник(-и)/ассистент(-ы) курса.

Как правило, на курсе должен присутствовать Силлабус, с которым могут ознакомиться студенты.
Готовый силлабус просим направить личным сообщением в телеграм: <https://t.me/Mls181>.
В основном описании курса можно указать: цели, контакты преподавателя и ссылки на репозитории на Телеграм-канал/чат по вашему предмету.

Элементы материалов на курсе:

Обязательство перед УИ

Накопление методических материалов - силлабус, материалы по курсу,
накопление артефактов студентов - домашние работы, выполненные в электронном. формате должны быть доступны из Moodle..

Вы можете добавлять блоки, например, структурируя ваш курс строго по неделям, а затем добавлять в блок каждой недели конспекты лекций, записи лекций, научные статьи, презентации, видео, задания, тексты и т.д.

У большинства элементов курса можно задать ограничения: время начала, окончания. Есть возможность выставить ограничения: пока не будет пройден “опрос”, “итоговый тест” не откроется для прохождения.

Есть возможность добавления элементов по учебным материалам на курс в Moodle: лекционный и практический материал, тесты, задания, опросы и т.д. загружаются преподавателем/помощником преподавателя.

Оценивающая обратная связь - это задания и тесты, оцениваемые в Moodle, должны содержать обоснование оценки. Это может включать в себя четкие схемы оценки, личные отзывы о загрузках учащихся, отзывы об их ответах на открытые вопросы и т.д.

Оценки/Grades выставляются в отдельном разделе, но зависят от критериев оценивания по вашему предмету. Например, можно настроить в формате “А” ”В” ”С” ”D”, и/или PASS/FAIL, выставить % по критериям из силлабуса.

Справочная информация по разделу: оценки и их настройка: <https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Grades>

Если по каким-то настройкам у вас возникли вопросы, вы можете обратиться к <https://t.me/Mls181> за помощью и консультацией по вопросам работы на портале Moodle.

Какие-то загруженные туда документы? Что делать обязательно?

Как только вы получите доступ к курсу, вам следует:

Загрузить или свяжите программу курса, предпочтительно в виде вики-страницы edu.
Создать элемент посещаемости, а затем создайте внутри него учебные занятия.
Проверка посещаемости обязательна для факультативов и лабораторных работ (проверка “Посещаемость” на Moodle <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGCZRMbXsec>
Создавайте разделы курса, предпочтительно в соответствии с темами учебной программы.
Создайте все классифицированные действия с указанием крайних сроков подачи заранее.

Я обязан общаться со студентами в мудле или можно и отправлять им учебные материалы как мне удобно?

Вы можете заранее загружать задания в Moodle и скрывать от студентов, а открыть когда надо будет.
Можно делиться ссылкой в чат/канал в Telegram со студентами на задания из Moodle.

Как сделать формулу для выставления оценок, чтобы она соответствовала моей схеме оценивания, существующей на курсе?

Moodle по умолчанию одинаково взвешивает все назначения и использует шкалу букв по умолчанию. Чтобы настроить это поведение, пожалуйста, обратитесь к меню оценок курса. Полезные советы даны в этом видео о настройке оценок и в этом видео об оценке в середине семестра. Администрация университета NB автоматически импортирует итоговые оценки из Moodle, поэтому вы должны убедиться, что оценки верны в течение 2 дней после итогового экзамена.

Форум Moodle по теме оценок и их настройки доступен по ссылке: <https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Grades>

Если по каким-то настройкам у вас возникли вопросы, вы можете обратиться к <https://t.me/Mls181>.

```
за помощью и консультацией по вопросам работы на портале Moodle.

```

Сколько у меня есть времени на проверку домашек? Есть какой-то обязательный срок, когда оценки должны стоять?

У каждого преподавателя свои критерии и сроки на проверку домашних заданий и результатов тестирования.
Срок не должен превышать дату экзамена.
Если вы проводите домашнее задание, вы обязаны сообщить студентам, сколько вы его проверяете. Рекомендованный срок - одна неделя.

К кому обращаться, если я не понимаю, как пользоваться каким-то функционалом мудл?

# Introduction to MediaWiki

The MediaWiki software is used by tens of thousands of websites and thousands of companies and organizations. It powers Wikipedia and also this website. MediaWiki helps you collect and organize knowledge and make it available to people. It's powerful, multilingual, free and open, extensible, customizable, reliable, and free of charge.

# Content editing

## How to log in the system?

Use your regular credentials for this purpose: user@innopolis.ru and the password from your account.
If you cannot log in, please contact the IT-department [@iuithelp](https://t.me/iuithelp)

## How to create a page?

**From the search box** 
If you search for a page that doesn't exist, then you will be provided with a link to create the new page.

**Using the URL** 
You can use the wiki's URL for creating a new page.

The URL to an article of the wiki is usually something like this:

* <https://eduwiki.innopolis.university/index.php/ARTICLE>

If you replace ARTICLE with the name of the page you wish to create, you will be taken to a blank page which indicates that no article of that name exists yet.

> To get more detailed information you can refer to the user's manual:
> [Help: Starting a new page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Starting_a_new_page)

## How to edit a page?

Clicking the "Edit" page tab at the top of the page will take you to the edit page for that article, where you can create the new page by typing your text, and clicking submit. Moreover, if you need not edit the whole page but only its part, you can click on "Edit" link related to this certain part and work only with it. If the text is so long it helps to save a time.

Note that only the authorized users are able to edit the content.

> Here you can get more information about the editing process: [Help:Editing pages](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Editing_pages)

## How to work with text and its structuring?

> Detailed user guide on text formatting: [MediaWiki: User guide](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MediaWiki_User_Guide)

### How to structurize a text?

Headings are created using sequences of "=" characters, placed before the heading title and after the heading title, on the same line. The level of headings is determined by the number of "=" characters.

Examples:

| Level | Example |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | ==Plants== |
| 3. | ===Plants=== |
| 4. | ====Plants==== |

*Start level:* 2

Do not use headings of level 1, such as "=Title="; start with level 2 instead. The heading at level 1 is used for the title of the page.

*Maximum level:* 6

The maximum level of a heading is 6, rendered using ======Heading L6======. Entering a heading with 7 equals-signs such as =======Heading L7======= results in the creation of a heading of the level 6, with one equal-sign becoming part of the text of the heading: "=Heading L7=".

> See more details here: [MediaWiki user guide: sections and headings](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MediaWiki_User_Guide/Sections_and_Headings)

### How to format text?

The following is an overview of text formatting available in Mediawiki:

| Formatting | Markup | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Boldface | '''text''' | |
| Italics | ''text'' | |
| Boldface and italics | '''''text''''' | |
| Boldface combined with wikilink | '''[[text]]''' | The reverse order of ticks and brackets does not work:[['''text''']] |

Other text formatting such as underline or blockquote needs to be done using HTML tags, including U for underline, TT for typewriter text, S for strikethrough, SUB for lower index and SUP for upper index.

### How to use HTML tags?

Text formatting can also be done using HTML and CSS. Some of the most useful HTML elements are:

| Task | Markup | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Preformatted text | <pre>preformatted</pre> | The effect in wiki differs from the one in HTML; in wiki, the text within the PRE element is treated as within NOWIKI element, leaving all the HTML and wiki markup uninterpreted. |
| Blockquote | <blockquote>Longer passage.</blockquote> |
| Comments | <!-- comment --> | Avoid nesting, such as<!-- <!-- comment -->--> |
| Generic inline element | <spanstyle="TODO"></span> | Can be styled arbitrarily using cascading style sheets - CSS. |
| Generic block element | <divstyle="TODO"></div> | Can be styled arbitrarily using cascading style sheets - CSS. |

Some HTML elements are not allowed, such as A and IMG.

### How to work with lists?

Bullet lists:

| Example Syntax | Example Output |
| --- | --- |
| \* a
\*\* b
\*\* c
\*\*\* d | abcd |

Numbered lists:

| Example Syntax | Example Output |
| --- | --- |
| # a
## b
## c
### d | abcd |

Definition lists:

| Example Syntax | Example Output |
| --- | --- |
| ; defined term : definition
; defined term 2 : definition 2 | defined termdefinitiondefined term 2definition 2 |

Mixed lists:

| Example Syntax | Example Output |
| --- | --- |
| \* a
\*# b
\*# c | abc |

### How to insert a link?

There are five types of hypertext links in MediaWiki, but two of them are the mostly used:

* Internal links to other pages in the same wiki (commonly called "wikilinks")
* External links to pages at other websites

**Internal hyperlinks**

| Task | Markup |
| --- | --- |
| Internal hyperlink | [[keyword]] |
| Internal hyperlink to a section | [[keyword#section\_heading|link title]] |
| Internal hyperlink showing a different word | [[keyword|its appearance]] |
| Internal hyperlink with a tooltip | [[keyword|<span title="A tooltip">its appearance</span>]] |
| Internal hyperlink in bold | '''[[keyword]]''' |

**External hyperlinks**

| Task | Markup |
| --- | --- |
| External hyperlink | [URL\_containing\_no\_spaces title of the URL] |
> You can also fing some more details here: [Help: links](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links)

## How to format tables?

The following code

```
{| class="wikitable" style="height:14em;"
|-
! Left !! Center !! Right
|-
| Top left cell || Top center cell || Top right cell
|- style=height:7em
| Middle left cell || Middle center cell || Middle right cell
|-
| Bottom left cell || Bottom center cell || Bottom right cell
|}

```

gives the following:

| Left | Center | Right |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Top left cell | Top center cell | Top right cell |
| Middle left cell | Middle center cell | Middle right cell |
| Bottom left cell | Bottom center cell | Bottom right cell |
> Basics: [MediaWiki User guide: Tables](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MediaWiki_User_Guide/Tables)

> Advanced: [Wiki: Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Table)

## How to work with math formulas?

You can enter mathematical formulas into a wiki, using a `math` tag, such as:

```
<math>\sqrt{2}</math>

```

The formulas are marked up in the TeX markup, the markup of a complex typesetting system specialized on mathematics.

To get started, follow the examples below.

| No. | Desired Effect | Markup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | α{\displaystyle \alpha } | <math>\alpha</math> |
| 2. | 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} | <math>\sqrt{2}</math> |
| 3. | 1−e2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {1-e^{2}}}} | <math>\sqrt{1-e^2}</math> |
| 4. | 24=0.5{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}=0.5} | <math>\frac{2}{4}=0.5</math> |
| 5. | ∑k=1Nk2{\displaystyle \sum \_{k=1}^{N}k^{2}} | <math>\sum\_{k=1}^N k^2</math> |
| 6. | ∫13e3/xx2dx{\displaystyle \int \limits \_{1}^{3}{\frac {e^{3}/x}{x^{2}}}\,dx} | <math>\int\limits\_{1}^{3}\frac{e^3/x}{x^2}\,dx</math> |
| 7. | [0⋯0⋮⋱⋮0⋯0]{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}0&\cdots &0\\\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\0&\cdots &0\end{bmatrix}}} | <math>\begin{bmatrix}0&\cdots&0\\\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}</math> |
| 8. | (xyzv){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}x&y\\z&v\end{pmatrix}}} | <math>\begin{pmatrix}x&y\\z&v\end{pmatrix}</math> |

## How to put a source code?

The following code:

```
‎<syntaxhighlight lang="python" line>
def quick_sort(arr):
	less = []
	pivot_list = []
	more = []
	if len(arr) <= 1:
		return arr
	else:
		pass
‎</syntaxhighlight>

```

gives:

‎

```
def quick_sort(arr):
	less = []
	pivot_list = []
	more = []
	if len(arr) <= 1:
		return arr
	else:
		pass‎

```

> See the documentation of the syntaxhighlight-extension here: [Syntax highlight](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight)

## How to add TikZ-flowchart?

With the use of the special extension you can embed the TikZ-flowchart written in LaTex directly to your page within the tag

```
<PGTikZ>
```

.

For examle, the following code

```
<PGFTikZ>
[[File:My_image_1.png|400px|test image]]

<PGFTikZPreamble>

\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows}
\usetikzlibrary{intersections}

## How to paste pictures?

Mediawiki supports the use of images in various formats. In order to be used in a wiki, image first needs to be uploaded. To upload the picture please use the link "Upload file" in the left menu column of the page and follow the certain instructions.

The following is an overview of placing images into pages, such images that have already been uploaded.

| Task | Markup | Default Frame | Note |

## How to embed a Google document into mediawiki page?

Special extension allows to embed Google Docs' spreadsheets into the wiki page.

Supported parameters are:

| Name | Default |
| --- | --- |
| width | 500 |
| height | 300 |
| style | width:100% |

As an example using all of the parameters:

```
<googlespreadsheet width="600" height="200" style="width:50%">Google Docs' key goes here</googlespreadsheet>
```

To actually embed a spreadsheet, the spreadsheet needs to be published with Google's **File** > **Publish to Web...** option. It is not sufficient to just have a shareable link.
